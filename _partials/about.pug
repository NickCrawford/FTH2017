		h1 Help redefine the future of fashion
		p Hackathons are the new way to push the boundaries of what you know
			| and learn what you don't. They provide an environment to learn,
			| explore, and engage to complete a project with a set amount of time.
			| Students spend 36 hours building a project of their choice,
			| such an app or a garment, while getting support from mentors
			| and sponsors. Participants meet companies looking to hire while
			| getting their hands on the latest tech. Students are given the opportunity
			| to solve problems they see in the world by utilizing fashion and technology.
